Its significance was fully realized only after similar tablets were uncovered elsewhere in southern Italy. The Greek inscription promises the deceased that she “will reign [with the other] heroes” in the Underworld. The tablet was cut down to fit into the Roman amulet case that hangs on a gold chain, suggesting reuse in antiquity—or an adjustment in the nineteenth century.",
